# Normalize.scss v3.0.1

Normalize.scss is a customisable SCSS file that makes browsers render all
elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

The project relies on researching the differences between default browser
styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need or benefit from
normalizing.

## What does it do?

* Explains what code does using detailed comments.


## How to use it

No other styles should come before Normalize.css.
